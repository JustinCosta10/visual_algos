# visual_algos

A collection of visualized algorithms built using Python. Each algorithm relies on **NumPy** for data operations and **Matplotlib** for rendering visuals. Visualizations animate in a Matplotlib window at a watchable pace.

Each algorithm accepts a graph defined by an adjacency-list dictionary and a collision map indicating which nodes are inaccessible.

Credit to Professor Nikolaus Correll and his Intro to Robotics course at CU Boulder for inspiring this project through its focus on path-planning algorithms in robotics.

## Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Algorithms

* **BFS**
* **DFS**
* **Dijkstra's**
* **A_star**

There is a visual rendered version and a non-visual version for each algo.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
