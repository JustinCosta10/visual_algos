# visual_algos

A collection of visualized algorithms built using Python. Each algorithm relies on **NumPy** for data operations and **Matplotlib** for rendering visuals. Visualizations animate in a Matplotlib window at a watchable pace.

Credit to **Professor Nikolaus Correll** and his **Intro to Robotics** course at CU Boulder for inspiring the Matplotlib-based animated visualization method used in this project.
