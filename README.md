# visual_algos

A collection of visualized algorithms built using Python. Each algorithm relies on **NumPy** for data operations and **Matplotlib** for rendering visuals. Renders in a matplotlib window at a viewable pace.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

If using a virtual environment (recommended), ensure it is activated before installing.

## Algorithms

* BFS
* DFS (soon)
* Djikstras (soon)
* A* (soon)

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Usage

After installing dependencies, run any algorithm script directly:

```bash
python {algorithm}.py
``''
